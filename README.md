# HTML CSS GIT CODE REFRACTORING

## Description
My motivation for this project was to take an existing site and refractor the code to make it more accesible to screen readers and better position it for seo. By building this project I have increased my skills in improving existing code without changing it's functions.
By achieving this refractoring I have made a more accessible and searchable website for my client. I learned that HTML and CSS are a delicate balancing act and one doesn't work as well without the other. I also learned that organization is key when recoding an existing site.
